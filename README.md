Fraud detection in financial transactions is a critical challenge facing institutions worldwide due to the escalating sophistication of fraudulent activities. This paper proposes an innovative approach to bolstering fraud detection through the integration of advanced techniques such as machine learning, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics.

HOW TO USE :
1) COPY THE SOURCE CODE OF CRDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION FROM credit_card_fraud_detection(1).py .
2) UPDATE THE CODE IN ANY COMPILER WITH DATABASE (GOOGLE COLAB).
3) UPLOAD THE DATASET INTO THE SESSION STORAGE OF THE COMPLER.
4) UPDATE THE LOCATION OF DATASET IN CODE IF NEEDED.
5) NOW FRAUD DETECTION CAN BE IMPLEMENTED ON THE GIVEN DATASET USING LOGIC REGRESSION BY RUNNING THE CODE .
